      #
      # Bitbucket Server supports a powerful type of pattern syntax for
      # matching branch names (similar to pattern matching in Apache Ant). You
      # can use branch permission patterns when adding branch permissions at
      # the project or repository level to apply a branch permission to
      # multiple branches.
      #
      # These expressions can use the following wild cards:
      #
      #   ?   Matches one character (any character except path separators)
      #   *   Matches zero or more characters (not including path separators)
      #   **  Matches zero or more path segments.
      #
      # Pattern used in branch permissions match against all refs pushed to
      # Bitbucket Server (i.e. branches and tags).
      #
      # In Git, branch and tag names can be nested in a namespace by using
      # directory syntax within your branch names, e.g. stable/1.1. The '**'
      # wild card selector enables you to match arbitrary directories.
      #
      #   * A pattern can contain any number of wild cards.
      #   * If the pattern ends with / then ** is automatically appended - e.g.
      #     foo/ will match any branches or tags containing a foo path segment
      #   * Patterns only need to match a suffix of the fully qualified branch
      #     or tag name. Fully qualified branch names look like
      #     refs/heads/master, while fully qualified tags look like
      #     refs/tags/1.1.
      #
      # Example patterns tested against branch name bugfix/that/cool/perm-test:
      #
      # *                                      matches
      # **                                     matches
      # **/perm-test                           matches
      # **cool**                               does not match
      # **perm-test                            does not match
      # **test                                 does not match
