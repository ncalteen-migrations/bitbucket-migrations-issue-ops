    ## Run the migration
  
    Add a comment to this issue with one of the following two commands in order to run a migration:
  
    **Dry-run**
  
    We recommend to do a "dry-run" migration first which **will not lock your source repository**. Users may continue working on the repository.
  
    \`\`\`plain
    /run-dry-run-migration
    \`\`\`
  
    **Production**
  
    After you have verified your "dry-run" migration and after you have announced the production migration to your users, add a comment with the following command to start the production migration. It **will lock your source repository** and make it unaccessible for your users.
  
    \`\`\`plain
    /run-production-migration
    \`\`\`
    `
  } else {
    core.setFailed('The issue body could not be parsed')
  }

  await github.rest.issues.createComment({
    issue_number: context.issue.number,
    owner: context.repo.owner,
    repo: context.repo.repo,
    body: body,
